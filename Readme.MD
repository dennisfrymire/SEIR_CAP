# quote App

## User Stories

### I want users to...

- Have a randomly generated quote appear on a randomly generated background when page first loads
- Have the option to add that quote to their own collection of quotes
- Be able to search for quotes by category (Happiness, Motivation, etc.), and be able to save them to their own collection.
- Add and edit quotes of their own

### Stretch user stories...

- Be able to share quote on social media
- User authentication

## Technologies

- React / React Router
- Reactstrap / Bootstrap
- Express
- JavaScript
- JSX
- MongoDB / MongoAtlas
- NodeJS

## Challenges

- Mongo Atlas. It is connected to the Heroku app and works as long as I have my local server running, but not otherwise. This apparently seems to be a common issue. 

- Working with 3rd party API. I originally wanted to use GraphQL as a stretch goal. I spent 2-3 days working on that, but ended up falling back to a RestAPI, but wasn't able to successfully connect it and a search function with my app.

- Overall design is a little too simplistic.

- Overall, time management. I spent the first several days of the project attempting to learn new technologies to incorporate, and spent too much time in this phase. 

## If I had to do it over

- I would spend less time researching new technologies and dove into actually building the app sooner. 

## What do I want to revisit

- User authentication - allow users to have accounts where they can save their own collection of favorite 
- A search function 
- Include optional imagery with submitted quotes
- Overall design of the app
- Create an accompanying mobile app

## What went well

- Discovering React Router. I first struggled with picturing how I would render each component once I decided to abandon React Native and use the Create-React-App we used in class. Once I came across React Router, the basic layout of the front end fell into place. 

- Using MongoDB. The Heroku/Atlas issues aside, I feel like I have a pretty decent grasp on Mongo. Setting up the backend routes and initial database was the easiest aspect of this project.

- Feeling like I developed more of a "Programmer's Brain" with this project. I came into bootcamp knowing this was all going to be a challenge. I'm a novice. This isn't my wheelhouse or background. I get frustrated when I can't quickly figure out an answer. I get the thoughts of "Oh, God, what am I doing with my life?" A couple of nights ago, I spent about an hour debugging my Heroku deployment, and I feel like something clicked - I found myself actually enjoying working out the bugs.
